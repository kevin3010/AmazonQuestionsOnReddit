[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1j0lqo4/amazon_sdeii_interview_experience_rejected/) <br>**Technicial/LLD/SystemDesign** <br>- There's a game called Vegetable Crush. In this game, you are allowed to choose two dissimilar veggies and cut them. Each type of veggie is represented as an integer in an array. Formally you can choose any 2 unequal integers in the array and delete them. Given an array `veggies` of size `n`, return the minimum possible number of veggies left after the given operation is performed any number of times. <br>- You've a canvas of `n x m` size which is initially painting white, waiting to be transformed in to a beautiful canvas. Each minute the canvas goes under a unique coloring process as specified by the user. A beautiful canvas is defined by the presence of a square with a side length of `k` where all cells within the square are elegantly colored. Determine the minimum time required for the canvas to achieve the beauty. You'll be provided `n, m, k` as input, along with a 2D `paint` array of `n*m` dimension representing the coordinates of the cell to be painted at ith minute. <br>- In a game of chess, you are given that there are `n` players, and a list of `m` matches between players. If a player has won a match from another player then it is said that the winning player has higher rank than the losing player. Also, if `ith` player wins from `jth` player then `ith` player will win from all the players `jth` player won from. The `matches` array will be a 2D array where `matches[i]` tells us that `matches[i][0]` won against `matches[i][1]`. You're tasked to return the maximum number of players for which you can deterministically identify the ranks. <br>- Design cricket scoreboard application, something similar to Cricbuzz with commentary, score updates, innings analysis, and player analysis.

[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1ibb8o3/got_crushed_by_the_question_asked_in_recent/) <br>**Technicial/LLD/SystemDesign** <br>- Given a binary array containing 0s and 1s. You can flip the bits at most k times. Return maximum sum of the length of subarrays, where each subarray is an array of only 1s and has length greater than given integer n. (Example: 1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0,00,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1, k = 2, n = 4, answer = 15. "maximum sum of the length of subarrays" means you can distribute your flips to multiple sub arrays. the final number will be sum of all these sub array's length. you need to return maximum final sum possible) <br><br>
