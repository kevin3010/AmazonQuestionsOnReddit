### 🛠️ Technical / LLD / System Design
- questions
- Paint a fence but with twist. We have planks of different heights that we need to paint and width is 1 for all. Brush width is also 1. We can make a stroke either horizontally or vertically. Give the minimum strokes we can make to paint the complete fence.
- There is a stream of values coming. Window size is M and a value K is given. Values are coming one by one. Return average of values that remain after topK and bottomK values are not being included. Until window has M values, return -1 from the function. As soon as size becomes = M. Return the average. (1- start pushing new value and and removing least recent value in window if window already M sized. 2- Return average of values remaining after topK and bottomK values are not included.)
- Design a calculator. Again stream of values are coming as key presses. After each key press, Only return what will be displayed on the screen. Also operators cannot be displayed on the screen. Only numbers.
