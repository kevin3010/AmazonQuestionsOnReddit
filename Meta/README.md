**[Reddit Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/leetcode/comments/1hyh0wf/targeting_the_meta_production_engineer_inteview/)**

### 🧑‍💼 Behavioral
- Describe a challenging problem you faced at work and how you resolved it.
- Tell me about a time when you had to collaborate with someone whose working style was different from yours.
- Why do you want to work at Meta?
### 🛠️ Technical / LLD / System Design
- Every day, at roughly the same time, a process keeps crashing on one of the Linux servers in production. You look at the logs, and the last line says `Exception: Failed to allocate 1GB for ...`. It's a Linux server, and you quickly run the `free -h` command and find that the server actually has 1GB of memory free. Furthermore, swapping has been disabled on the machine since it runs performance-critical applications, and swapping would cause an unacceptable performance hit. So the processes on this machine have been intentionally configured not to take advantage of disk memory via swapping. How come the process can't allocate 1GB even though 1GB is available?
- What is the difference between TCP and UDP protocols?
- What is the difference between a process and a thread?
- How to interpret the output of `free -h` on a Linux server?
- How would you troubleshoot a system where an application fails to start on the server?
- How would you diagnose a slow or crashing webserver?
- In as much detail as possible, explain what an operating system is and what it does.
- Typical questions revolve around reading data from log files, using `awk` to extract certain columns, and processing (sorting, filtering, etc.) to get a certain output.
- Determine if a given string is a palindrome.
- Iterate through a 2D array and count the number of cells that satisfy a condition.
- Use binary search to find an object satisfying a certain condition in a sorted array.
- What is a zombie process?
- How does the `kill` command work at the kernel level?
- Explain how virtual memory works in Linux using the example of a process trying to read data in a specific block of memory.
- An application is running slowly, and investigation reveals it is heavily swapping and this is impacting performance. How would you resolve this issue?
- How would you design a chat application like WhatsApp?
- Pick any system and design it.
- Describe step-by-step what happens in the interval between a user entering a URL like `www.facebook.com` into a browser and the page rendering.
